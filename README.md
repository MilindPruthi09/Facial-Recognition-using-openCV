# Facial-Recognition-using-openCV

Made in collab with Chinmaya Purohit(Github Profile: GeNeRaL-ShAdOw)

In this project I used HAAR cascade algorithm. First, we need to load the necessary XML classifiers and load input images (or video) in grayscale mode. Then we can do the image manipulation where the image can be resized, cropped, blurred, and sharpened. The haar-Like feature algorithm is used to find the location of the human faces in frame or image. Then we extract the features from the image, with the help of edge detection, line detection, and center detection.
